VLAN Segmentation & DHCP Strategy

This document outlines the VLAN segmentation strategy used in the CENBANK network, including how VLANs are deployed across distribution switches, trunked to core routers for inter-VLAN routing, and mapped to DHCP pools for dynamic IP address allocation.


1. VLAN Architecture Overview

CENBANK uses a hierarchical network design:

•	Access Layer: End devices connect to access switches.
•	Distribution Layer: VLANs are defined and managed here.
•	Core Layer: Core routers handle inter-VLAN routing via trunk links.

> VLANs are configured on “distribution switches” and “trunked to core routers” using 802.1Q encapsulation. This allows for centralized routing and policy enforcement across all segments.

> Each VLAN is isolated at Layer 2 and routed through the core for Layer 3 communication. DHCP pools are assigned per VLAN and distributed via IP helper addresses.

4. Routing & Trunking Notes

•	Trunk Ports: All distribution switches trunk VLANs to core routers using 802.1Q.
•	SVIs: Core routers host Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) for each VLAN.
•	DHCP Relay: IP helper addresses forward DHCP requests to the central DHCP server.
•	Security: ACLs restrict inter-VLAN access based on business rules.


 5. Best Practices

•	Use descriptive VLAN names and consistent ID assignments.
•	Document DHCP pools with gateway, subnet, and lease parameters.
•	Validate trunk configurations with `show interfaces trunk`.
•	Monitor DHCP leases and conflicts regularly.
